Data Visualization is the first step towards getting an insight into a large data set in every data science project. Once the data has been acquired and preprocessed (cleaned and deduplicated), the next step in the Data Science Life Cycle is Exploratory Data Analysis which kicks off with visualization of the data. The aim here is to extract useful information from the data.
I have used Python and its few powerful libraries to achieve the task.
